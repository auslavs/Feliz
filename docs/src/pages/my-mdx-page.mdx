# My MDX page

This is a MDX page

import MyComponent from '../components/MyComponent';

<MyComponent />

export const Highlight = ({children, color}) => (
  <span
    style={{
      backgroundColor: color,
      borderRadius: '2px',
      color: '#fff',
      padding: '0.2rem',
    }}>
    {children}
  </span>
);

<Highlight color="#25c2a0">Docusaurus green</Highlight> and <Highlight color="#1877F2">Facebook blue</Highlight> are my favorite colors.

I can write **Markdown** alongside my _JSX_!

```fsharp
let x = 1

type Components = 

    [<ReactComponent>]
    static member MyComponent() =
        Html.div [
            Html.h1 "Hello from F#"
            Html.p "This is a paragraph in F#"
        ] 
```
